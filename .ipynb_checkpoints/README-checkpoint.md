# Topological Insulators in Crystals

Experimental and main codes for a project on Topological Insulators in Crystals.

## Description

This repository is created for a proejct on topological insualtor in crystals. In particular, it includes computational analysis of several models of topologial insulators.

Based on this analysis, a publication is published, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.L201110"> see paper </a>

Regarding files, experimental_1.ipynb contains rather experimental code, and examines several results for papers mentioned therein. 
TopologyCrystallineTIs2.ipynb focused more on the goal of the publication even though it is yet to be completed, maybe in the future.

**Sidenote:** While reproducing these result I used linux cloud server of <a href="https://cloud.linode.com"> Linode </a>, they provide the same hardware for approximately seame price, but my connection to their server was more stable than to AWS and I am in Berlin. In the case of AWS, my connection was broken during long computation several times, but not even once when using Linode
